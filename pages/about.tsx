    <Text>
      I'm currently focused on building <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">ReactNative</a> applications{' '}
      and front-end solutions with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a>,{' '}
      <a href="https://redux.js.org/">redux</a> or <a href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/">useQuery</a>{' '}
      and TypeScript. I also have experience on the backend and setting up infrastructure. At the moment I would not mind to do some more backend
      work. Also, learning Rust when I have some spare time. Is very nice. {'\n\n'}
      My background is in Physics, I've studied it in <a href="//www.ugr.es">Granada</a> (Spain){' '}
      and in <a href="//www.lmu.de">Munich</a> (Germany). I like to solve problems, the simpler{' '}
      the solution the better. I'm from a{' '}
      <a href="//goo.gl/maps/pNam2Bxtsyw">tiny town in Ja√©n</a>{' '}
      (Spain). I like talking with people.{' '}
      I've had 3 bands in Granada for which I made some songs and sing.{' '}
      The first contact I had with web development was in winter 2012. Started with{' '}
      <a href="//nodejs.org">nodejs</a> which led to{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/strongloop/express">express</a>,{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/jadejs/jade">jade</a> and{' '}
      <a href="//mongodb.org/">mongodb</a>, moved to{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/meteor/meteor">meteor</a>{' '}
      after which I wanted to really learn something from the ground up so I looked around and found{' '}
      <a href="//facebook.github.io/react">React</a>,{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/faye/faye">faye</a> and{' '}
      <a href="//github.com/gulpjs/gulp">gulp</a>.{' '}
      I prefer doing things and then talking about them instead of the other way around.{' '}
      I like kindness and honesty. I believe in patience and hard work.
